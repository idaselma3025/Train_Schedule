# Train_Schedule
# What this project does:
This program allows the user to enter relevant train information (Train Name, Train Destination, Train Frequency, Train Start Time).  The program then calculates when the next train will arrive and how many minutes away the train is.

The program updates arrival time and how many minutes away the train is every minute.

The program allows the user to remove each train from the UI and database.

#Getting Started with Train_Schedule:
Users can enter information right away when they open the program.  After enter the parameters, users can click submit.  Their train information should be displayed in the table with the calculated values of "Arrival Time" and "Minutes Away."

If users wants to remove a train, they can click "Remove" next to the train they wish to remove.  The train will be removed permanently from the database and UI.

#Getting Help With Train_Schedule:
Users can get help with Train_Schedule by contacting the extremely helpful and knowledgeable Brian David and Tom Brossart.  They have graded many, many Train_Schedule projects and are more than willing and able to help.  If I had their email addresses I would include them here, but I can only bother them on a private slack workspace.

#Train_Schedule Maintenance:
Ida Jensen will be updating and maintaining this program, which she plans to do, so that she can add more styling before Tom or Brian grade this, so they are not bored to death looking at another stupid train project.
